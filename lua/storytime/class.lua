---Define a Lua class.
---
---A a Lua class emulates object-oriented programming and enables inheritance hierarchies.
---It also provides the ability for Lua "classes" to extend C++ classes.
---
---This function is an implementation of the function described in the book "Game Coding Complete: Fourth Edition":

---
---@param parent_class table|nil The parent class table to inherit from. Expected to also be created with this function. If the class doesn't inherit from any parent class, this should be nil.
---@param class_body table|nil The class body table containing the members and methods of the class. Defaults to an empty table if nil.
---@return table A new class table with members and optional inheritance.

            -- C++ parent classes, that binds Lua together with C++ (a.k.a. "bindings"), needs to obtain Lua references to the
            -- fields and functions defined in the Lua class table so that C++ code can invoke them.

        -- Copy metafields and metafunctions from the class table to the instance metatable.
        --
        -- In C++, you can define custom operators on a class. For example, you can override the `+` operator on a class so that you
        -- can add two instances of that class together in the same you would add two numbers together.
        --
        -- Lua tables can also define custom operators. When we are mimicing OOP like this, we want to define these custom operators
        -- on the class tables, and have the instances be able to use them automatically.
        --
        -- Because the instance metatable and the class table are two different tables, we have to manually copy all custom operators
        -- from the class table to the instance metatable so that the instance can use them.
